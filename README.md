## 📞 What It Does

A patient calls a Twilio phone number. The AI bot:

1. Greets the patient in Hindi
2. Asks for their **name**, **appointment date**, **time slot**, and **medical reason**
3. Detects if they are booking **for themselves or a family member** (mother, father, child etc.)
4. Handles **multi-turn conversation** — remembers answers across turns
5. Confirms the booking in natural Hindi speech
6. Saves everything to **Google Sheets** automatically
7. Sends a **WhatsApp notification** to the clinic

All in Hindi. On a real phone call. Zero human involvement.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Patient calls Twilio number
        ↓
Twilio STT (SpeechResult)
        ↓
n8n Webhook receives transcript
        ↓
Edit Fields → normalizes data
        ↓
If node → checks if transcript is valid
        ↓
Code in JavaScript → extracts slots
   - Name extraction (15+ regex patterns)
   - Date extraction (Hindi keywords + month map)
   - Time slot extraction (Hinglish + Devanagari)
   - Medical reason detection (keyword matching)
   - Third party relation detection
        ↓
If1 node → all slots collected?
   ├── YES → Append to Google Sheets
   │          → Send WhatsApp notification
   │          → Voice confirmation TwiML
   └── NO  → Ask for missing slot in Hindi
              → Pass collected slots as query params
              → Wait for next turn
```
